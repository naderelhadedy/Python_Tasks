# file handling

file = open("", "") / takes file name then mode and the default is 'r' > read

# a \ append
#  r \ read
# w \ write
# x \ create

>> absolute path / relative path

# os / operating system library to be imported
# import os
> to get path of current working directory
>> print(os.getcwd())

> return the absolute path of the current opened file
>> print(os.path.abspath(__file__)

> takes file name and returns containing folder name
>> print(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))) / directory of the opened file

> change current working directory and takes directory ot be the main / you can give it the current dir of your file
>> os.chdir(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))


# to give the directory like argument but it can have a problem in it if there was a folder starting with n for example
"c\nader\nfiles\nader.txt" >> here \n can make a problem and will understand it as an order not just a name
so to overcome this give it r letter before "" to understand it as raw and ignore the content of it

file = open(r"c\nader\nfiles\nader.txt")


# read, loop and close

# write, append, cursor position
